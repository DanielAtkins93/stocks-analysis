#Stocks Analysis

##Overview
  The purpose of this project is to expand upon our previous macro and increase its efficiency so that it can be applied to a larger number of tickers by running more quickly. 
  
##Results
  Per below, we can see that 2017 was a far better year than 2018 in terms of these stocks' performance:

  When comparing our refactored macro to the base macro, we see quite an improvement in run-time:

##Summary
  ###Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code
      The key advantage to refactoring code is that you can simply create a better, more efficient, and more easily understood product. The disadvantage is that this     takes time, it can be tedious, and it can keep you from advancing on other projects. The task of the coder is to determine which projects supply the greatest degree of utility when deciding what they should spend time on.
      
   ###Specific Advantages and Disadvantages to this VBA script
        As mentioned, the key advantage to refactoring this specific VBA script is to decrease its run-time in order to apply it to a greater number of stock tickers. The disadvantage is that refactoring takes time which could be put to use elsewhere.

Overally, I believe we have demonstrated that refactoring is a desirable skill to learn and generally has many positive use-cases.
